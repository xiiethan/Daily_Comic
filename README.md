Website that fetches the Comic of the Day and a given comic using XKCD api

**node index.js** will launch site from 

Heroku Link - [Heroku](http://heroku.com)





## Instructions:
1. Your page should have a homepage which contains the comic of the day.
2. You should also have a second page (second ejs file that is rendered) and it should display the random comic. (hint use random number generator, but remember to have a upper bound)
3. Your pages should display the comic (day, month, year), the title, description, and the image and there should be a clear distinction that would let me know I am on the home page or the random comic page
4. Your pages should have a nav making it possible to navigate from comic of the day to the random selection. Every time I reload the page the random comic should change. (Bonus and not required: If youre feeling up for a challenge then you could also implement a button to change the random comic without a refresh)
5. The page should be using Bootstrap and should also have some additional styling by using a custom style sheet. 
6. Your page should be hosted in Heroku.
7. The readme of the page should be properly filled out and should include some markdown to make it look nice.
8. The final deliverable will be the working project. You will submit the github link with the readme containing the link to your Heroku.
